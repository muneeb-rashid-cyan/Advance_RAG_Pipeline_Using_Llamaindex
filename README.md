# Advance RAG workflow.

This project focuses on enhancing the GPT Documents chatbot by introducing several innovative features across different stages of development, aimed at improving user interaction, search accuracy, and response quality. 


## Project Overview:

1. **ChatBot with Streaming, Memory, and Sources**: The initial version introduces streaming for real-time response delivery, memory for contextual conversations, and source indication for transparency. Technologies like Llama-index and Chainlit are utilized to facilitate a more intuitive and informative chatbot experience.

2. **Vector DB Integration, Hybrid Retriever, and Advanced Ingestion**: Subsequent updates include Pinecone integration for efficient vector data handling, a hybrid retriever combining dense and sparse vector methods for improved search relevance, and advanced ingestion techniques for better document retrieval and processing.

3. **Reranker, Query Transformations, and Response Synthesis**: Further enhancements incorporate the Cohere reranker for semantic document reordering, multi-step query transformations for detailed query processing, and response synthesis methods for generating more accurate and comprehensive answers.

4. **Evaluation - Generation - Optimization:** This stage involves the systematic generation and evaluation of the RAG in the following metrics; correctness, relevancy, faithfulness and context similarity.

5. **Intent Detection Agent:** Integration of an agent for effective user intent detection, streamlining the query process and enabling more efficient and precise information retrieval by redirecting queries to a more compact and cost-efficient language model.
