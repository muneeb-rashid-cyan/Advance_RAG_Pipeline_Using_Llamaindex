# Adding vector db, hybrid retriever and improved ingestion

In this updated version, we've added three major features to enhance the repository:

1. **Vector DB Integration**: We've integrated Pinecone for efficient vector data handling, improving real-time analysis and insight extraction.

2. **Hybrid Retriever**: Implements a blend of dense and sparse vector methods, enhancing search accuracy and relevance.

3. **Advanced Ingestion**: Employs specialized techniques like Unstructured for general documents and LLM Sherpa for PDFs, plus metadata enhancement to improve document retrievability and context for LLMs.
