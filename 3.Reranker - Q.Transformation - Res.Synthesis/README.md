# Adding reranker, query transformations and response synthesis.

This repository leverages the synergy between Cohere reranker and a hybrid retriever to merge the strengths of keyword and vector-based searches with sophisticated semantic reranking. This innovative approach guarantees not only the retrieval of a wide array of pertinent documents but also organizes them in a manner that aligns seamlessly with the user's intentions.

To enhance query processing, we implement two additional methods:

1. **Multi-Step Transformations**: This method deconstructs intricate queries into simpler, more manageable subquestions, each of which is then executed against the database. The responses obtained from these subquestions guide the construction and execution of follow-up queries, ensuring a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the user's original inquiry.

2. **Refine**: This approach methodically processes each piece of retrieved text, making individual calls to the Large Language Model (LLM) for each text chunk. This sequential refinement enables a progressive enhancement of the answer, ensuring that each chunk contributes to a more complete and accurate response.

By incorporating these methods, the repository not only improves the precision and relevance of search results but also ensures a deeper, more nuanced understanding and response to complex queries, enhancing overall search performance and user experience.
