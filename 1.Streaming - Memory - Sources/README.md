# ChatBot with streaming, memory and sources

Embarking on the creation of an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system marks a significant first step towards innovative chatbot development. This foundational version incorporates three critical features:

- **Streaming:** Enhance user experience with fast, real-time answers as the chatbot generates responses on-the-fly, reducing wait times.
- **Memory:** Facilitate natural, conversational interactions by enabling the chatbot to recall previous parts of the conversation, adding context and relevance to the dialogue.
- **Sources:** Increase transparency and trust by clearly indicating the origin of the chatbot's answers, allowing users to understand where the information is coming from.

These functionalities are powered by technologies like the Llama-index and Chainlit, setting the stage for a more intuitive, responsive, and informed chatbot experience.
